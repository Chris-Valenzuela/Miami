This program takes an LRW Tab Excel and outputs a "Heatmap" (i.e color conditioned) visual of the tabset. There are currently three views and still at its prototype stage. 
The three views are:

    - 'side': Which makes a copy of the table and pastes it to the right of the table position
    - 'end': Which makes a copy of ALL the tables and pastes them to the end in order. 
    - 'bottom': Which makes a copy of the table and pastes it at the bottom of the table (without creating a new worksheet)

To run this:
    - python miami_3.5.py - which will prompt the type of view you want. 
    - 'side', 'end', & 'bottom'
